Beautifully Crafted Ticketing for your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Beautifully Crafted Ticketing. Give your customers the experience they deserve.

Your event starts the second a customer goes to buy a ticket. More than two thirds of people say that a bad purchase experience stops them from coming back.

Line-Up is the benchmark for customer experience when it comes to ticketing. Whether the ticket is bought online or on the door, we’ve raised the bar, across the board.

The Line-Up WordPress plugin is the easiest way to sell tickets directly on your WordPress site. See your conversion increase with our 3-click checkout flow.

The benefits of using Line-Up to sell tickets on your WordPress site:

Adding the WordPress plugin to my site was as easy as copying and pasting a code into WordPress – took less than 5 minutes."_
